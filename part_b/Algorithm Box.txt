                            Algorithm 1: regular irt algorithm
Result: train a single irt model
Output: thetas, betas

# regular irt algorithm, no changes needed


                            Algorithm 2: split the training data
Result: split the training data into subsets
Output: a subset of the training data

# randomly split the training data into subsets


                            Algorithm 3: irt ensemble algorithm
Result: train an ensemble of irt models
Output: list of thetas, list of betas

theta_lst = []
beta_lst = []
int repeat
for i in range(repeat):
    # split the training data
    train_data = split_data(data)
    # train a single irt model
    thetas, betas = irt(train_data)
    # store the thetas and betas in a list
    theta_lst.append(thetas)
    beta_lst.append(betas)

return theta_lst, beta_lst


                            Algorithm 4: evaluate the ensemble
Result: evaluate the ensemble of irt models
Output: the accuracy of the ensemble model

total_correct = 0
for i in range(len(data["user_id"])):
    prdict_lst = []
    for j in range(len(theta_lst)):
        # make prediction for each model and store it in a list
    # take the average of the predictions

# then calculate the accuracy
return total_correct / len(data["is_correct"])
